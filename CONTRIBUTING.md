## Have a patch?

We welcome all code contributions to the library. If you have a patch adding value to the SDK, let us know üí™! Before you [submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-sdk-swift-testing/pull/new/master), make sure that you first create an Issue to explain the bug or the feature your patch covers, then make sure similar Issue or PR doesn't already exist.

Your Pull Request will be run through our CI pipeline, and a project member will review the changes with you. At a minimum, to be accepted and merged, Pull Requests must:

- have a stated goal and detailed description of the changes made;
